# SAE Features

## What's a Feature?

Sparse Autoencoders identify many **features** in a model, each representing a concept or pattern that the model has learned. A **feature dashboard** on Neuronpedia is an interactive way to examine a feature, showing:

- Statistics and metadata
- Positive and negative logits
- Correlated neurons
- Top activations
- Auto-generated explanations
- Custom activation testing

## Feature URLs

Each feature has a unique ID: `[MODEL_ID]@[SAE_ID]:[FEATURE_INDEX]`

Features are located at: `https://neuronpedia.org/[MODEL_ID]/[SAE_ID]/[FEATURE_INDEX]`

### Example Feature

Let's explore feature 650 from GPT2-Small, layer 6, SAE Set `RES_SCEFR-AJT`:

## Feature Dashboard Components

### Basic Statistics

Every feature dashboard shows:
- **Activation frequency** - How often the feature activates
- **Max activation** - Strongest activation value seen
- **Feature sparsity** - How selective the feature is
- Hover over (?) icons for detailed explanations

### Logits Analysis

View the top positive and negative logits to understand:
- What tokens the feature promotes
- What tokens the feature suppresses
- How the feature influences model outputs

### Top Activations

See real examples of text where the feature activated strongly:
- Highlighted tokens show activation strength
- Click to explore activation patterns
- Sort and filter by activation values

## Auto-Interpretation & Explanations

**Updated in November 2024** with EleutherAI integration!

### What is Auto-Interpretation?

Auto-interpretation uses AI models (GPT-4, Claude, or specialized explainers) to generate human-readable explanations of what a feature detects.

![Screenshot of a feature explanation at https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small/6-res_scefr-ajt/650](img/feature-explanation.png)

### Multiple Explanation Methods

Generate explanations using different approaches:

1. **GPT-4 / GPT-3.5-Turbo** - Based on top activations
2. **EleutherAI Explainer** - Specialized interpretability model
3. **Community explanations** - Human-written descriptions

### Explanation Scoring

Explanations can be scored to evaluate quality:

- **GPT-based scoring** - Traditional scoring method
- **EleutherAI Embedding** - Semantic similarity scoring
- **EleutherAI Fuzz** - Fuzzy matching scoring
- **EleutherAI Recall** - Recall-based evaluation

Scores range from 0-100. Click any score to see scoring details:

### How to Generate Explanations

1. Navigate to a feature dashboard
2. Click the explanation type dropdown
3. Select your preferred method (e.g., "EleutherAI Explainer")
4. Click "Generate"
5. View the explanation and optional score

You can also vote on explanations and add your own!

## Test Activations

**Updated with sharing functionality in November 2024!**

Every feature can be tested with custom text to validate theories and explore behavior.

### How to Test

1. Find the "Test Activations" section on any feature
2. Enter your custom text
3. View activation strengths on each token
4. Adjust text to explore different contexts

### Share Your Tests

**New:** Click the **"â†‘ Share"** button to:
- Generate a shareable link with your custom test
- Share activation results with colleagues
- Embed tests in documentation or posts
- No more screenshots needed!

See [Search documentation](search) for more details on sharing.

## Feature Lists

Organize and curate collections of interesting features:

- **Create lists** with descriptions and themes
- **Add features** from any model or SAE
- **Share lists** publicly or keep them private
- **Collaborate** with other researchers

Lists are perfect for:

## Accessing Features Programmatically

### JSON API

Get feature data in JSON format by adding `/api/feature/` to the URL:

**Feature page**: [`https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small/6-res_scefr-ajt/650`](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small/6-res_scefr-ajt/650)

**JSON endpoint**: [`https://www.neuronpedia.org/api/feature/gpt2-small/6-res_scefr-ajt/650`](https://www.neuronpedia.org/api/feature/gpt2-small/6-res_scefr-ajt/650)

### Python Library

Use the Neuronpedia Python Library for easy programmatic access:

```python
from neuronpedia import NeuronpediaClient

client = NeuronpediaClient()

# Get feature data
feature = client.get_feature(
    model="gpt2-small",
    sae_id="6-res_scefr-ajt",
    index=650
)

# Generate explanation
explanation = client.generate_explanation(
    feature_id=feature.id,
    method="eleuther"
)

# Test with custom text
activations = client.test_feature(
    feature_id=feature.id,
    text="Your custom text here"
)
```
