## What is Neuronpedia?

[Neuronpedia](https://neuronpedia.org) is an **open source platform** for mechanistic interpretability research. It's both a public database of useful data for researchers (including activations, explanations, metadata, and more), as well as a suite of free APIs and tools that accelerate white-box understanding and experimentation of neural networks.

Since March 2025, Neuronpedia has been fully open source - meaning you can use the hosted version at neuronpedia.org, or deploy your own custom instance with your own models and data.

Neuronpedia has expanded beyond its initial focus on Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to support all forms of mechanistic interpretability research, including **circuit tracing**, **probes**, **concepts**, **transcoders**, and more.

## Open Source & Self-Hosting

As of March 2025, Neuronpedia is **fully open source**! This means you can:

- **Use the hosted version** at [neuronpedia.org](https://neuronpedia.org) (no setup required)
- **Deploy your own instance** with one click using Vercel
- **Fork and customize** for research projects or startups
- **Contribute code** to benefit the entire community
- **Access 4+ terabytes** of public interpretability datasets

### Quick Deploy

Deploy your own Neuronpedia instance instantly:

- Llama 3.1 (8B)
- Llama 3.2
- Pythia models
- Qwen3 (4B)
- And more being added regularly

## Why Neuronpedia?

**TL;DR** - Researchers do research. We accelerate them by doing everything else: visualizations, tooling, sharing/collaboration, scaling, and hosting.

Whether you're a mechanistic interpretability researcher, a student learning about AI safety, or someone curious about how neural networks work, Neuronpedia provides the infrastructure you need to explore, understand, and experiment with model internals.

With open source access, you can now customize Neuronpedia for your specific needs - whether that's analyzing proprietary models, building applied interpretability tools, or conducting novel research.

## Research Focus

Neuronpedia was created to accelerate mechanistic interpretability research and support researchers working on AI safety and alignment. The platform infrastructure is designed to be model-agnostic and method-agnostic, supporting not just Sparse Autoencoders but all approaches to understanding model internals - including probes, concepts, transcoders, circuit analysis, and future methods yet to be developed.

We work closely with researchers at leading labs and universities to ensure Neuronpedia meets the needs of cutting-edge interpretability science.
